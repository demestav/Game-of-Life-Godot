# Conway's Game of Life
An implementation in Godot game engine

## How it works
The `tilemap` node is at the heart of the game. The game starts with a random set of cells. At each iteration, the fate of each cell is evaluated against a fixed set of rules. The new cell set is drawn and the process repeats.
